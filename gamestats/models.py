#This class represents a game played. If a simulation runs 1000 games, 1000 of these are created (then compiled and destroyed)

#TODO Ideally figure out a way to have a calculated stat that can be updated so these games don't clog the database
#TODO Or figure out a cool way to have a large fucking database!!
